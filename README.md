# hello-world
Initial repository for ideas and testing stuff

I just realized that I have this GitHub account for 5 years and I am just now learning how to use it. 

I guess with me working as a Database Developer and on MS SQL Server only so far I did not need to use this, but I am now thinking on all the missed years to learn to program sooner.

Still better late, then never.
